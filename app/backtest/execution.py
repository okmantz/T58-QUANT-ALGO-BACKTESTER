"""
Bar-by-bar trade execution simulator.

Consumes OHLCV data + a standardized signal series (-1/0/1) + risk config
and produces a discrete trade list. Entries occur on the bar the signal
changes (filled at that bar's close, adjusted for spread/slippage); each
open trade is then walked forward bar-by-bar checking for stop-loss /
take-profit intrabar hits (using high/low) or a signal-driven exit.

This is intentionally a straightforward, transparent simulation appropriate
for an MVP -- no partial fills, no multi-leg positions, one open trade at a
time (consistent with the standardized long/flat/short signal model).

    the stop toward price as the trade moves favorably; it never widens.

    breakeven_trigger_r: once open profit reaches this multiple of the

    the entry price (only ever tightened, never loosened).

    whatever multiplier its rules currently imply (consecutive losses,
    today's realized P&L, progress toward a profit target). Evaluated
