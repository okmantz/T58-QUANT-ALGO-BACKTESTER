"""
Prop-firm evaluation + funded-account simulator.

Given a chronological sequence of trade P&Ls (plus their dates), walks the
account forward under a configurable set of prop-firm rules and determines:
  - whether/when the evaluation is passed
  - whether/when the account is failed (and which rule caused it)
  - whether/when the funded account reaches its first payout, and all
    subsequent payouts

This module is independent of *how* the trade sequence was produced, so the
exact same simulate_account() function is used both for the single
historical trade sequence (section 4 of the spec) and for every resampled
sequence inside the Monte Carlo engine (section 5).
