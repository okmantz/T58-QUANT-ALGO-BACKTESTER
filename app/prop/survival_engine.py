"""
Prop-Firm Survival Engine.

Every other number this app produces (net profit, profit factor, Sharpe,
even the plain Monte Carlo evaluation-pass/first-payout probabilities)
ultimately answers one question: "how profitable is this strategy?" That
is NOT the question a prop-firm trader actually needs answered. The real
question is:

    "Can this strategy survive a prop firm's rules long enough to get
     paid -- more than once -- after accounting for what it actually
     costs to keep trying?"

Those are different questions with different answers. A strategy with a
95% evaluation-pass probability that blows the funded account on its
first bad week is worse, in every way that matters to a trader's bank
account, than an 82%-pass strategy that reliably strings together three
or four payouts before it ever fails. Nothing else in this app currently
surfaces that difference. This module does.

It is deliberately built as a THIN layer on top of two modules that
already do the hard, validated work:

    app.prop.simulator     -- the single-account rules engine
                               (simulate_account / PropRules). Every
                               number in this module still comes from
                               that same function; this module never
                               reimplements prop-firm rule logic.
    app.monte_carlo.engine -- the resampling machinery (_resample_pnls /
                               _apply_slippage_stress / precompute_day_
                               structure / _max_losing_streak). Reused
                               here (not reimplemented) so a strategy's
                               survival numbers and its existing Monte
                               Carlo numbers are always computed the same
                               way, with the same statistical assumptions.

What's actually NEW here, that neither of those modules answers:

  Evaluation Survival   -- not just "did it pass" but WHY it typically
                           fails when it fails (daily-loss vs. max-
                           drawdown), how long a pass usually takes, how
                           bad the worst losing streak gets, and how long
                           the account takes to recover from its worst
                           drawdown episode.

  Funded Survival       -- probability of reaching not just the FIRST
                           payout but the 2nd and 3rd (most strategies'
                           odds fall off a cliff after the first -- this
                           is the number that reveals that), plus the
                           expected total payout actually collected
                           before the account eventually fails.

  Reset/Retry Economics -- the piece nothing in this app answers at all:
                           given what an evaluation attempt and a reset
                           actually cost, and given a trader's real cut
                           of each payout, what is the EXPECTED NET
                           PROFIT after however many attempts it
                           realistically takes -- including the
                           attempts that fail outright and cost money
                           with nothing to show for it? This is modeled
                           as a chain of independent attempts (see
                           `simulate_reset_chain`), each one an
                           independent resampled draw of the SAME
                           historical edge, continuing until the account
                           survives to the end of the available trade
                           history (treated as "still alive, stop
                           counting") or the trader runs out of resets
                           they're willing/able to pay for.

The `PropSurvivalScore` this module produces is the number this app
should actually be optimizing for when the goal is "give me a strategy I
can trust with my own money at a real prop firm" -- not profit factor,
not Sharpe, not even the plain evaluation-pass probability alone.

    A single 0-100 number that answers "can this strategy survive long
    enough to get paid, more than once, after what it actually costs to
    keep trying" -- deliberately NOT the same thing as any pure
    profitability metric. Weighted so that:

      - Passing the evaluation at all is necessary but not sufficient
        (0.20 weight) -- a strategy that only ever clears the eval and
        never gets paid still scores low.
      - Getting repeated payouts (1st/2nd/3rd, tapering weights) matters
        more than getting just one, since a strategy's odds typically
        fall off sharply after the first payout and that fall-off is
        exactly what a pure eval-pass or first-payout number hides.
      - Net-positive economics AFTER resets (0.25 weight) is the single
        largest component, since this is the number a trader's actual
        bank account experiences -- a strategy that passes evaluations
        constantly but never nets positive after paying for the
        privilege of resetting is not, in any real sense, a survivable
        strategy.
      - The two funded-account failure modes (daily-loss / max-drawdown)
        are subtracted, since a strategy that fails those rules often is
        actively dangerous to trade even when its average-case numbers
        look fine.

    This is one reasonable weighting, not a law of nature -- treat the
    breakdown dict as the actual audit trail, and the single score as a
    convenient sort key on top of it.
