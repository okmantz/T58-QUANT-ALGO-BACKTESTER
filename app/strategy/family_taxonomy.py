Strategy Family Taxonomy.

app.search.strategy_space already lets the Search Lab search ONE named
hypothesis family at a time, or "all" of them -- the missing piece is a
canonical vocabulary that (a) covers the full research universe Owen
asked for and the T58 Quant Trading Masterclass material itself
recommends (its Lesson 3 family table), and (b) can classify ANY
strategy this app can produce -- not just a app.search.strategy_space
grid candidate, but also an Ollama-generated Python strategy
(app.ai.research_loop), a GA-evolved genome (app.evolution.engine), or a
hand-uploaded Manual/Python/PineScript/MQL5 file -- into one of these
canonical groups, so results from every one of those sources can be
compared and ranked on the same axis. See app.search.family_diversity
for what actually gets BUILT on top of this classification (per-family
ranking, "don't let the optimizer generate 10,000 variants of the same
family" diversity caps).

Two classification paths, tried in order:

  1. Skeleton name -- exact and authoritative. Every named hypothesis
     family in app.search.strategy_space.FAMILIES encodes exactly ONE
     economic hypothesis (see that module's own docstring), so its
     skeleton name maps 1:1 onto a canonical group with total
     confidence -- no inference needed.

  2. Heuristic vote -- for anything that ISN'T a known skeleton (an AI-
     generated code strategy, a "single" mode candidate, a
     "<source>_grid" refinement of a user-supplied strategy, or a
     hand-uploaded file). Combines app.strategy.dna's already-proven,
     false-positive-resistant gene detector (weighted higher) with a
     small additional keyword table (weighted lower) covering the
     canonical groups app.strategy.dna doesn't tag at all -- it has no
     "trend", "mean_reversion", "breakout", "pullback", "vwap", or
     "volatility_contraction" gene, since its vocabulary was built for a
     different question (entry/exit/risk mechanics, not hypothesis
     family). The group with the highest combined score wins; ties break
     by a fixed priority order; no matches at all returns
     "uncategorized" rather than guessing.
