"""
Standardized strategy representation.

Regardless of source (manual rule builder, Python, PineScript, MQL5), every
strategy is reduced to a function that consumes an OHLCV DataFrame and
produces a standardized signal series. This lets the backtest engine remain
completely agnostic to strategy origin.

Signal convention:
    1  -> enter/hold long
    -1 -> enter/hold short
    0  -> flat / no position
