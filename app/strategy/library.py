"""
Persistent strategy library.

Lets a strategy (Python / PineScript / MQL5) be saved *inside* the app's own
data folder — the same persistent, writable, frozen-exe-aware location that
app.data.storage already uses for market-data CSVs — instead of only ever
being pulled from wherever it happens to live on a particular computer or
phone. Once saved, a strategy shows up in the library on every future run,
no re-browsing required. Uploading straight from a device is still fully
supported and is in fact how strategies get into the library in the first
place (save_strategy_path / save_strategy_bytes / save_strategy_text).

Folder layout (created on demand):

    <app base dir>/strategies/python/*.py            (+ *.py.meta.json sidecars)
    <app base dir>/strategies/pinescript/*.pine       (+ *.pine.meta.json sidecars)
    <app base dir>/strategies/mql5/*.mq5              (+ *.mq5.meta.json sidecars)

Mirrors app.data.storage.py's StoredDataset / list_stored_datasets /
store_csv_path / store_csv_bytes naming and behavior on purpose, so the two
subsystems stay easy to reason about side by side.

IMPORTANT — packaged .exe vs. the git repo: get_app_base_dir() (see
app/data/storage.py) resolves next to the running .exe for a frozen/
packaged build, but resolves to the repo root during normal development.
That means a strategy saved from a *built .exe* lands next to that .exe,
not inside your git repo, so it won't show up on GitHub until you copy it
over yourself (or use export_library_zip() below and unzip it into your
repo's strategies/ folder). Saving from the app run out of the repo
(`python -m app.web.server` / `python run_app.py`) writes directly into
the repo's strategies/ folder and needs no extra step.

Metadata sidecars (<file>.meta.json) hold everything besides the raw
source: description, market, timeframe, tags (list[str]), status (one of
STRATEGY_STATUSES -- the draft -> tested (failed/passed) -> validated ->
ready-for-demo -> ready-for-live lifecycle), and results other features
stamp onto a saved strategy after they run against it: last_run
(record_backtest_result), lookahead (record_lookahead_result), last_search
(record_search_result). None of that is required -- an entry with no
metadata at all is just a file with defaults (status "draft").
