"""
Python Strategy Adapter.

Loads a user-supplied .py file which must define a top-level function:

    def generate_signals(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
        ...  # returns a series of -1/0/1 the same length as df

Optionally the module may also define fixed, whole-backtest exit parameters:
    STOP_LOSS_PIPS = <float>
    TAKE_PROFIT_PIPS = <float>
    STRATEGY_NAME = "<str>"

DYNAMIC (per-trade) STOPS AND TARGETS
--------------------------------------
Many real strategies compute a stop/target that depends on the specific
setup (an ATR multiple, a zone boundary, a swing level) rather than a fixed
pip count. A fixed STOP_LOSS_PIPS cannot express this. To support it without
breaking the single-return-value contract above, the returned signal Series
may carry the following OPTIONAL keys in its `.attrs` dict, each a
Series/array-like of the same length as `df` (raw price units, NaN/absent on
non-entry bars — only the value on the entry bar itself is read):

    signals.attrs["stop_loss_distance"]       -> |entry - stop|
    signals.attrs["take_profit_distance"]     -> |entry - target|
    signals.attrs["trailing_stop_distance"]   -> raw-price trailing distance
    signals.attrs["breakeven_trigger_r"]      -> scalar float (e.g. 1.0 == "+1R")

When present, these take precedence over STOP_LOSS_PIPS/TAKE_PROFIT_PIPS for
the bars where they're defined. This is the ONLY way a Python strategy's own
computed stop/target actually reaches the execution engine — if your
strategy computes a stop or target and never attaches it here, the engine
has no way to know about it and will size/protect the trade using its own
generic fallback instead, silently discarding your intended risk management.

MULTI-TIMEFRAME BIAS FILTERS — A COMMON LOOKAHEAD TRAP
-------------------------------------------------------
If your strategy resamples the input data to a higher timeframe (e.g. a 1H
trend filter for a 15m entry strategy) and then filters it with something
like `htf[htf.index < timestamp]` to get "the last closed HTF bar", THIS IS
LIKELY A LOOKAHEAD BUG. A resampled bar is labeled by its START time, so
`htf.index < timestamp` includes the still-forming CURRENT bar for any
`timestamp` that isn't exactly on the HTF boundary — which was computed
using the full bar's data, including bars later than `timestamp` that
haven't happened yet. Use `app.strategy.mtf.completed_bars()` /
`last_completed_bar()` instead, which correctly requires the bar to have
fully closed (bar_start + timeframe <= timestamp) before using it. This
exact mistake was found in a real uploaded strategy and was, on its own,
responsible for the strategy's entire apparent edge (see app/strategy/mtf.py
docstring for the before/after numbers).

STRATEGIES CANNOT IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN "MAX DAILY LOSSES" GATE
----------------------------------------------------------------
generate_signals(df) is called ONCE, statelessly, over the entire dataset
before any execution or P&L exists. A strategy has no way to know whether
its own earlier trades that day won or lost, so any internal
"stop trading after N daily losses" counter a strategy tries to maintain is
silently a no-op — it can count trades taken, but never trades lost. If you
need a real daily-loss circuit breaker, use the engine's own
RiskConfig-level enforcement (see app/backtest/risk.py) rather than trying
to build one inside generate_signals().

WALK-FORWARD RETRAIN CONTEXT (OPTIONAL, for ML-style strategies only)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The "called once over the whole dataset" rule above still holds — this
does not change generate_signals(df)'s signature or how it's called for
a normal Run & Report backtest, GA search, or the vast majority of
strategies. It only affects app.validation.walk_forward_opt's per-fold
test evaluation, and only for a strategy file that opts in:

    RETRAIN_PER_FOLD = True   # module-level flag, checked via module_flag()

A strategy that FITS ITSELF TO DATA (see strategies/python/
ml_classifier_direction.py) needs to know a fold's real train/test
boundary to retrain correctly each fold — otherwise a fold-based harness
calling generate_signals separately on fold.train_df and fold.test_df
leaves the strategy re-deriving its own split from whatever fragment it's
handed, wasting the fold's actual designated training window (this was a
real bug, fixed by this protocol — see ml_classifier_direction.py's own
WALK-FORWARD SAFETY section for the before/after). When RETRAIN_PER_FOLD
is set, app.validation.walk_forward_opt.run_walk_forward_optimization
calls generate_signals ONCE on `pd.concat([fold.train_df, fold.test_df])`
instead of on fold.test_df alone, with:

    df.attrs["wf_train_end_index"] = <int, the row position where
                                        fold.test_df begins>

set on that combined frame. A strategy reading this attr should treat
rows [0, wf_train_end_index) as training data and only ever emit signals
at or after it — exactly the same causal-split discipline
ml_classifier_direction.py already applies via TRAIN_FRAC, just told the
real boundary instead of guessing one. `df.attrs.get("wf_train_end_index")`
is absent (None) for every other call path (normal backtests, GA search,
walkforward_ga.py's own per-fold parameter search), so a strategy that
checks it with `.get(...)` and falls back to its own TRAIN_FRAC logic
when it's None needs no other changes to keep working everywhere else.

The module is imported in isolation via importlib so a bad/malicious upload
cannot silently corrupt the running app's own modules; execution errors are
caught and surfaced as a clear StrategyError per the spec's requirement that
unsupported/invalid strategy code must fail loudly rather than produce a
silently inaccurate backtest.
