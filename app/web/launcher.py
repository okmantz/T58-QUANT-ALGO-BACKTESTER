T58 Quant Algo Backtester — phone-friendly launcher.

This is the entry point behind the "T58-Web-App.exe" build. It exists so
Owen (or anyone else) can:

    1. Download a zip from GitHub Releases.
    2. Extract it.
    3. Double-click T58-Web-App.exe.
    4. Get a QR code on screen -- scan it with a phone camera on the same
       Wi-Fi -- and the full backtester opens in the phone's browser,
       installable as a home-screen app (PWA) via "Add to Home Screen".

No hosting account, no app store, no Termux/third-party runtime on the
phone. The only requirement is that the PC running this .exe stays on
and both devices share the same Wi-Fi network while the phone is used.

This module does NOT duplicate the Flask app in app.web.server -- it
only adds the "find my LAN IP / show a QR code / open a browser" glue
around the exact same server, via app.web.network_info (shared with
app.web.server itself -- see that module's docstring for why running
`python -m app.web.server` used to show none of this).

    Why this exists: Windows closes a console window the instant the
    process that opened it exits. If main() failed here with nothing
    catching it, the very message that would explain what went wrong
    flashes past in a fraction of a second and the window vanishes --
    which is exactly what "the terminal appeared, but nothing was
    printed" looks like from the outside: the failure happened too fast
    to read, not that nothing happened at all. This catches BOTH an
    uncaught exception AND Werkzeug's own habit of calling sys.exit()
    directly on a startup failure (e.g. "port 5000 already in use") --
    the latter raises SystemExit, which a plain `except Exception` does
    NOT catch, so it would otherwise still slip through and close the
    window instantly even with error handling in main() itself. A clean
    Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt) or an explicit sys.exit(0) are left alone
