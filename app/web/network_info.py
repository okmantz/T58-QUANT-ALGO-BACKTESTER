Shared LAN-IP + QR-code helpers for the web app.

Before this module existed, there were TWO different ways to start the
web app, and only ONE of them ever showed a QR code or a LAN address at
all:

  - `python run_web.py` (or the built T58-Web-App.exe) -- via
    app.web.launcher -- printed a banner with the LAN address and popped
    open a QR code image.
  - `python -m app.web.server` (the "plainer alternative" the README
    also documented) -- called `app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)`
    directly, with NO banner, NO LAN-IP printout beyond whatever
    Werkzeug's own dev-server startup log happens to include, and NO QR
    code at all.

Reported symptom: "the qr code still doesn't generate" (there was
nothing to generate one *from* on this path) plus typing
`https://127.0.0.1:5000` into a phone -- which fails for two independent
reasons even on the launcher path: 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address
(meaningless from a second device), and this server is plain HTTP, not
HTTPS, so the `https://` itself never even completes a handshake.

Fix: one shared module, used by BOTH entry points, so both print the
identical banner and both can render the identical QR code -- and the
web app itself now also exposes this at `/mobile-access` (see
app.web.server), so the QR code is visible from a browser tab on the PC
itself, not only from a separate launcher script's popped-open image.

    """Best-effort detection of Wine (running the Windows .exe build on

    Why this matters here specifically: this app has exactly two
    Windows-only behaviors that get exercised in the phone-access flow --
    os.startfile() to pop open the QR code image, and the LAN-IP-guessing
    UDP-socket trick in get_lan_ip(). Under Wine, os.startfile() routes
    through whatever Wine has configured as the default handler for that
    file type, which on a bare/minimal Wine prefix (no real image viewer
    installed) can fall through to a legacy IE stub that shows a blank or
    garbled page instead of the image -- indistinguishable, from the
    outside, from "the QR code doesn't generate." Separately, Wine's own
    virtualized network stack can report a different local address than
    the host machine's real Wi-Fi interface, which would make the
    "LAN address" this module hands to the phone unreachable from any
    other device even though the server itself is listening correctly.
    Neither of those is a bug in this app's own code -- but silently
    failing with no explanation looks exactly like one, so callers use
    this to print a specific, actionable note instead.
