Regime Survival Matrix.

app.validation.regime_testing already answers one narrow question well:
"if this strategy only ever traded ONE volatility tercile, would it still
be profitable" -- via independent segment-by-segment re-backtesting. This
module answers a different, complementary question a trader actually asks
after a strategy has already passed evaluation: "of the trades this
EXACT strategy actually took, which kind of market condition were the
losers concentrated in -- and can I just gate the strategy off in that
condition going forward."

That's a trade-ATTRIBUTION question, not a re-validation question, so the
approach here is deliberately different and much cheaper: run the
backtest ONCE over the whole dataset (the strategy sees its real,
continuous history, exactly as it would live), classify every BAR into a
regime along four independent dimensions, then attribute each of the
strategy's own trades to whichever regime was active at its entry time
(the same "as-of" attribution app.ai.research_loop.diagnose_failure
already uses for its single ATR-based check). Segment re-backtesting
(regime_testing.py's approach) is still the right tool for asking "is
this edge real across genuinely different markets" -- this module is the
right tool for "which regimes should this specific, already-built
strategy avoid."

Four classification dimensions, every one computed causally (only ever
looking backward from each bar, never forward):

    trend        -- signed EMA-slope, ATR-normalized, qcut into 5 bins
                    (strong_bearish .. strong_bullish)
    volatility   -- ATR, qcut into 5 bins (very_low .. extreme) -- same
                    "quantile over the WHOLE dataset" convention as
                    regime_testing.py, for the same reason: the question
                    is "how does it do across genuinely different
                    environments actually present in this data", not
                    "how does it do when volatility is currently
                    changing" (a signal-level question, not a regime one)
    session      -- fixed UTC clock-time windows (Asia/London/NY Open/
                    NY/Power Hour) -- see _SESSION_WINDOWS. Assumes
                    timestamps are UTC, matching this app's existing
                    data-import convention (app.data.importer looks for
                    columns literally named "UTC"); DST is not modeled,
                    exactly like the existing session_time_effect family
                    in app.search.strategy_space.
    environment  -- a heuristic 5-way split (trending/ranging/breakout/
                    compression/expansion) from Bollinger Bandwidth level
                    + its own rate of change, crossed with trend strength.
                    This is a labeling heuristic, not a rigorous
                    detector -- see _label_environment for the exact,
                    documented priority order.

Every dimension's classifier is fit ONCE on the historical dataset and
its cut points (RegimeThresholds) are returned so the SAME cut points --
not a fresh quantile split -- can be reapplied to new/live bars later
(see classify_latest_regime). That's what makes "the strategy can simply
turn itself off during bad regimes" an actual, implementable statement
rather than just a backtest curiosity: the cut points a live deployment
would gate on are fit once, in-sample, and then held fixed.
