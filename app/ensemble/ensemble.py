"""
Multi-strategy ensemble backtesting -- several DIFFERENT, weakly-correlated
strategies combined on the SAME instrument. The mirror case of
app.portfolio.portfolio, which already does multi-ASSET/single-strategy;
this module is multi-STRATEGY/single-asset.

Two combination modes:

  "blend" (run_ensemble_blend) -- each strategy leg keeps trading
    independently at its own correlation-adjusted share of one account's
    risk budget, exactly like a Portfolio leg does today, just pointed at
    the SAME df for every leg instead of a different instrument each.
    Reuses app.portfolio.portfolio.run_portfolio_backtest UNMODIFIED --
    its measure -> correlate -> re-weight -> chronologically-merge pipeline
    doesn't care whether what varies between legs is the instrument or the
    strategy, so there is no reason to reimplement it. More than one leg
    CAN have a position open at the same time (each leg is really trading
    its own slice of the account independently); this is the right model
    whenever every leg's own stop/target/trailing-stop rules should keep
    applying unchanged.

  "vote" (run_ensemble_vote) -- combines every leg's own raw signal series
    bar-by-bar into ONE composite long/flat/short signal (only entering
    once at least `min_agreement` legs agree on direction), then runs that
    single combined signal through the ordinary one-position-at-a-time
    engine, same as any other strategy. True to how a real single-account,
    single-position "voted" ensemble actually trades -- unlike blend mode,
    only one position is ever open at a time. Risk management (stop,
    target, trailing stop, break-even) is inherited from the FIRST-listed
    leg only, since voting combines entry TIMING across legs, not each
    leg's own exit rules -- reach for blend mode instead whenever each
    leg's own risk management should keep mattering.

Both modes require at least 2 strategy legs, and both are aimed at the
same goal this app's Portfolio feature already demonstrated for
instruments: several imperfectly-correlated return streams smooth the
combined equity curve (and therefore raise real eval-pass probability)
in a way no amount of re-tuning a single strategy's own parameters can.
