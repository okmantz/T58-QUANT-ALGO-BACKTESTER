Evolution Lab checkpointing.

Owen's ask: "if I start and stop the generation, it doesn't just start
over from scratch, but has a baseline to work off of." Before this
module, EVERYTHING an EvolutionRunner tracked (generation counter,
current elites used to seed the next generation's children, the
all-time leaderboard, the hypothesis journal) lived only in the
EvolutionRunner instance's memory -- clicking STOP then START again
built a brand new EvolutionRunner with generation=0, elites=[],
leaderboard=[], journal=[]. The knowledge graph (app.evolution.
knowledge_graph) was the only thing that survived a restart, and it
only informs the journal's confidence narrative, not what the next
generation actually is.

This module persists exactly the state needed to resume a run:

    generation           -- the next generation number to run
    elites               -- (spec, meta) pairs used to seed mutated
                             children next generation
    leaderboard          -- serialized EvolutionCandidateRecord summaries
                             (all-time best seen)
    journal              -- the numbered HYPOTHESIS text entries
    data_fingerprint      -- a cheap fingerprint of the market data the
                             run was using, so resuming against a
                             DIFFERENT dataset is detected and refused
                             (silently "resuming" a EURUSD run's elites
                             against freshly loaded XAUUSD data would
                             produce nonsense) rather than silently
                             mixing incompatible runs.

Storage: one JSON file at `path` (default data/evolution/checkpoint.json
under the app's writable base dir), overwritten after every generation.
This is deliberately NOT the knowledge graph (which is an append-only
cross-run log of every candidate ever evaluated, used for similarity
lookups) -- this is "resume exactly where THIS run left off."
