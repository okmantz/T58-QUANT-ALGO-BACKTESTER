"""
PROP FITNESS -- the composite score the Evolution Lab (app.evolution.engine)
selects and ranks candidates by, instead of raw profit.

    PROP FITNESS =
        pass_probability x payout_probability x robustness x oos_consistency
        / drawdown
        - penalties(too_few_trades, high_param_sensitivity, high_pbo,
                     is_oos_degradation, concentration, losing_streaks)

Every input is a signal this codebase already computes elsewhere (Monte
Carlo, app.search.robustness's parameter-neighborhood robustness and
walk-forward efficiency, app.validation.cpcv's genuine PBO/CPCV
degradation, app.backtest.statistics' own drawdown/streak/trade-count
numbers) -- this module's only job is combining them into one ranking
number, consistently, in one place, so the Evolution Lab's PRE-FILTER,
CLUSTER, and KEEP TOP N steps are all comparing candidates on the same
scale.

This is deliberately NOT the same thing as
app.optimize.refinement.compute_fitness's "composite_prop_score" metric,
which is cheap (Monte Carlo only) and used INSIDE the GA's inner loop
where it has to run hundreds of times per generation. PROP FITNESS is
the expensive, only-computed-once-per-surviving-candidate score used for
final ranking after robustness/OOS/CPCV/stress have already run.
