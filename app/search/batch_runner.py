"""
Search Lab batch runner -- Stages 1 through 5.

    Stage 0 (app.search.strategy_space)  generates the candidate pool.
    Stage 1  Cheap filter        -- one fast backtest per candidate, no Monte
                                     Carlo, run in parallel across CPU cores.
                                     Kills the vast majority of candidates in
                                     minutes, not hours.
    Stage 2  GA refinement       -- the app's EXISTING Iterative Refinement
                                     genetic algorithm (app.optimize.refinement,
                                     completely unmodified), applied to each
                                     Stage 1 survivor in parallel instead of
                                     to one hand-picked strategy at a time.
    Stage 3  Validation gate     -- full-fidelity Monte Carlo, multi-fold
                                     walk-forward (no re-tuning), the generic
                                     lookahead-bias detector, a cost-ladder
                                     stress test, and parameter-neighborhood
                                     robustness. A candidate must clear every
                                     gate to pass -- this is deliberately
                                     strict, because Stage 1/2 alone WILL
                                     surface noise at this scale.
    Stage 4  Leaderboard         -- every candidate at every stage is
                                     persisted to SQLite (app.search.results_db);
                                     Stage 3 survivors are ranked by a
                                     composite score that includes the
                                     Deflated Sharpe Ratio, which corrects
                                     for how many candidates were tried.
    Stage 5  Champion promotion  -- app.search.batch_runner.promote_champion()
                                     re-runs one chosen candidate through the
                                     app's existing, trusted
                                     generate_full_report() pipeline, so it
                                     "graduates" into the exact same report
                                     format every other strategy in this app
                                     produces.

Runs in "single" mode (one user-supplied strategy, re-validated through the
exact same funnel) or "family" mode (a generated grid) -- see
app.search.strategy_space. Both use this one pipeline; single-strategy mode
is not a separate code path.

Multiprocessing note: worker processes load the market data ONCE at pool
startup (via ProcessPoolExecutor's `initializer`) rather than having it
pickled through IPC on every one of potentially thousands of per-candidate
tasks. Workers only ever return small, JSON-safe dicts -- never DataFrames
or Trade objects -- back to the main process, which is the only process
that writes to the results database.
