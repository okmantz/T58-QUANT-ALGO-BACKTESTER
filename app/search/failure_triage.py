"""
Auto-triage failure reasons at scale.

When a Search Lab / Evolution Lab batch discards hundreds or thousands of
candidates, a per-candidate log line ("candidate abc123: failed") tells
Owen nothing about WHY the batch failed as a whole -- whether every single
candidate timed out on the same session filter, all failed the same
drawdown check, or produced zero trades. That distinction is exactly what
decides whether the fix is "run it longer" or "the search space itself is
wrong" (see app.strategy.family_taxonomy / app.search.strategy_space for
the family-library side of that same question).

This module aggregates one stage's worth of raw candidate result dicts
(the same shape app.search.batch_runner._stageN_task functions return)
into a small, ranked "reason -> count" summary, optionally broken down
per family, so a wall of thousands of individual failures collapses into
a handful of lines worth actually reading.
