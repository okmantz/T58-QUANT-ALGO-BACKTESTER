Statistical robustness tools for the Search Lab.

These exist because of one specific risk: running thousands of independent
backtests does not just create more chances to find a real edge -- it
creates, overwhelmingly more, chances to find a FAKE one that looks
excellent purely by chance on this exact historical window. This is the
same trap already hit once by hand in this project (an IV-wall signal that
looked strong on 34 trades and vanished on 97 -- see
/areas/prop-firm-falsification-kit.md). At "thousands of variations" scale
that trap gets much easier to fall into, not harder, unless something
explicitly corrects for it. Every function here does exactly that:

  deflated_sharpe_ratio()            -- corrects the champion's Sharpe for
                                         HOW MANY candidates were tried
                                         before it was picked (Bailey &
                                         Lopez de Prado, "The Deflated
                                         Sharpe Ratio", 2014).
  run_walk_forward()                 -- checks the SAME config (no
                                         re-tuning) across several rolling
                                         train/test folds, not just one
                                         80/20 split.
  parameter_neighborhood_robustness() -- checks whether nearby parameter
                                         values still work. A real edge
                                         lives in a plateau; a value that
                                         only works at one exact parameter
                                         setting is fit to noise in this
                                         window, not to a tradeable effect.

None of these functions can tell you a strategy IS good. They can only
tell you when the evidence for "good" doesn't hold up to scrutiny -- which,
at this scale, is the more important of the two questions.
