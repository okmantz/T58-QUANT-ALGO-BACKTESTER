# Every extension the importer (app.data.importer.SUPPORTED_DATA_EXTENSIONS,

# data. list_stored_datasets() and the bundled-data seeder below used to
# hardcode "*.csv" only, which meant a .parquet (or .tsv/.txt) file sitting
# right there in data/raw was invisible to the desktop app's stored-dataset
# list AND the web app's dropdown even though selecting/importing it would
# have worked fine -- kept in sync with the importer's own sets rather than
# duplicated as separate literals so the two can't drift apart again.
#
# UPGRADE (2026-09-03): .zip and .7z were missing from this tuple even
# though app.data.importer has fully supported reading both for a while
# (_read_zip/_read_7z, py7zr already in config/requirements.txt) -- an
# archive sitting in data/raw/ was importable if you somehow got its path
# into the app, but never showed up in the "Available Datasets" list or the
# web dropdown in the first place, so in practice it was invisible. Fixed
# by importing SUPPORTED_ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS from the importer instead of
# re-guessing it here -- exactly the kind of drift this tuple's own comment
# already warned about.
