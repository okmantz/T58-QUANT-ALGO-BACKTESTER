T58 Strategy Scorecard.

Implements the T58 Quant Trading Masterclass material's Part XI scorecard
verbatim: a single 0-100 number built from already-computed, already-
trusted signals this app produces elsewhere -- never a new metric
invented here, only a documented way of weighting and combining what
already exists:

    Metric                      Weight   Source
    Pass probability              25     app.monte_carlo.engine.MonteCarloResult.evaluation_pass_probability
    First payout probability      20     ...first_payout_probability
    Risk of ruin                 -20     ...risk_of_ruin_pct (subtracted)
    Walk-forward stability        15     app.search.robustness.WalkForwardResult.walk_forward_efficiency
                                          (or CPCV, if that's the run's chosen primary generalization
                                          test -- see app.orchestration.full_pipeline's
                                          primary_robustness_method config; whichever one is primary
                                          for a given run fills THIS slot)
    Monte Carlo robustness        10     see _mc_robustness_score below
    Parameter stability            5     app.validation.parameter_robustness.ParameterRobustnessResult
                                          (or the cheaper app.search.robustness.RobustnessResult, if
                                          that's the one already computed -- both are 0-100-like already)
    Expectancy                     5     app.backtest.statistics.BacktestStatistics.average_r
    Drawdown                      10     app.backtest.statistics.BacktestStatistics.max_drawdown_pct
    Parsimony                      5     app.scoring.parsimony.ParsimonyResult.score -- reward for
                                          reaching the same result with fewer unnecessary degrees of
                                          freedom (see that module). A modest tiebreaker weight, not a
                                          dominant factor -- pipeline reorg plan section 24.
    CPCV / PBO (supporting)        5     app.validation.cpcv.CPCVResult -- only populated when CPCV was
                                          run as a SECOND, supporting diagnostic alongside a different
                                          primary generalization test (walk-forward), never when CPCV
                                          IS the primary test (that would double-count the same
                                          evidence in two components -- see section 40/41 of the
                                          pipeline reorg plan on avoiding exactly this).

Tiers, also verbatim from the Masterclass material:

    92+  Elite       85+  Strong       75+  Promising      65+  Research      <65  Reject

Several of these inputs (Monte Carlo robustness, parameter stability,
expectancy, drawdown, parsimony, CPCV-as-supporting) aren't already
expressed on a 0-100 "higher is better" scale in this app, so this module
documents exactly how each is mapped onto one -- see the docstring on
each _*_score helper. Every mapping is a heuristic; none of them invents
a new backtest metric, they only rescale ones that already exist.
`score_from_results()` does that mapping for you from the objects this
app's own pipeline already produces; `T58ScorecardInputs` is there for a
caller that wants to supply the 0-100 numbers itself (e.g. from records
already persisted in app.search.results_db, where a fresh Monte Carlo/
robustness object may not be sitting in memory anymore).

IMPORTANT -- missing-aware, not a gate: compute_t58_score() re-normalizes
over whichever components are actually present (see its own docstring).
A strategy that hasn't been walk-forward tested yet, or whose parsimony
couldn't be counted, is NOT penalized as if it had failed that check --
it's simply scored on the evidence that does exist. This is what makes
it safe to use as the Full Pipeline's actual verdict logic (see
app.orchestration.full_pipeline._make_verdict) instead of a hard AND
across every metric.
