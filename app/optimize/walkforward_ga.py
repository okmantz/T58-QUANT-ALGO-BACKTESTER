"""
Walk-forward-aware genetic algorithm.

Iterative Refinement's GA (app.optimize.refinement) scores every
candidate genome by backtesting it on the WHOLE dataset and computing
fitness from that single in-sample run. That means the GA is free to
evolve toward whatever squeezes the most fitness out of that one
historical window -- exactly the overfitting failure mode this app has
hit for real, more than once, via lookahead bugs that inflated in-sample
numbers (see the champion-selection history in this project). A GA is a
particularly efficient way to find and exploit noise, precisely because
it tries so many variations.

This module runs the identical GA operators (crossover, mutation,
tournament selection, elitism, random immigrants -- all imported directly
from app.optimize.refinement so the two never drift apart) but scores
each genome differently: it splits the data into several chronological
folds (see app.validation.walk_forward_opt.build_folds), and a genome's
fitness is computed ONLY from backtesting that SAME fixed genome on each
fold's held-out test slice and chaining the results -- never from the
training slices, and never from the full dataset. A genome that only
works on one specific historical stretch, rather than generalizing
across several distinct ones, will simply score lower here and get
selected against -- which is the entire point.

This directly answers "stop the optimizer from just curve-fitting
harder": the optimizer can still evolve toward whatever works, but
"works" is now defined as "keeps working on data it never got to fit
against," across every generation, not just at a final holdout check
tacked on at the end.

    parallel: when True (the default) and the search is large enough to be
    worth it (see _MIN_EVALUATIONS_FOR_PARALLEL), each generation's genome
    evaluations run across multiple worker processes instead of one at a
    time in the calling process -- this is normally THE dominant cost of
    a Full Pipeline run, so this can cut a multi-minute search down
    substantially on a multi-core machine. Genome GENERATION (which
    genomes get tried) always stays single-process and deterministic;
    only backtesting/scoring an already-decided genome is parallelized, so
    results are the same as the fully-serial path modulo which CPU
    happened to run which candidate. Any failure to start the worker pool
    falls back to the single-process path automatically. max_workers caps
    how many processes are used (default: up to os.cpu_count()).

    ai_suggest_cb: optional, called with the strategy's discovered `genes`
    list once per generation (including generation 0's initial population)
    when the optional AI assistant (see app.ai.ollama_client) is enabled.
    Returns a list of already-clamped-and-validated genomes to inject into
    that generation's population, replacing some of what would otherwise
    be random immigrants/offspring -- never an elite, so a bad AI
    suggestion can never displace a genuinely better candidate, only
    compete for the non-elite slots on equal footing. Any exception the
    callback raises, or an empty list, is treated exactly like AI assist
    being off: the generation proceeds with its normal random/bred
    population, unchanged.

    Callbacks may optionally accept a SECOND argument: the prior
    generation's already-evaluated population as `[(genome, fitness), ...]`
    (an empty list for generation 0, before anything has been evaluated).
    This is the systematic "Stage 4 analysis and feedback" hook from the
    quant loop framework -- see app.optimize.gene_fitness_analysis, which
    a two-argument callback can run itself (pure statistics, no extra
    backtests, no AI call) to tell an AI assistant which parameter regions
    are already known to score well or badly before asking it for new
    candidates. Detected via the callback's signature so existing
    single-argument callbacks (including every one in this app's own test
    suite) keep working unchanged.
