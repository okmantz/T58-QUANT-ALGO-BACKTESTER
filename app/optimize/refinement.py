"""
Iterative Refinement engine.

A small, dependency-free genetic algorithm that searches a strategy's
numeric parameter space for the configuration that scores best on a chosen
fitness metric, evaluated on the SAME historical dataset used for the
normal backtest. Works across all four strategy sources this app supports:

  Manual        -- every tunable numeric leaf in the config dict
                   (see app.optimize.parameter_space)
  Python        -- every top-level SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE numeric constant
                   (see app.optimize.code_parameter_space)
  PineScript    -- every input.int()/input.float() default, plus the
                   T58_SL_PIPS/T58_TP_PIPS directives
  MQL5          -- every literal iMA()/iRSI() period, plus the same
                   T58_SL_PIPS/T58_TP_PIPS directives

Each "generation":
  1. keeps the top `elite_count` candidates from the current population unchanged
  2. breeds the rest via tournament-selected crossover + mutation
  3. injects a small fraction of fresh, fully-random candidates ("random
     immigrants") to keep the search from collapsing onto one local optimum
  4. re-evaluates the new population (backtest -> prop simulation ->
     a *cheap* Monte Carlo pass) and scores it

Across generations the population's parameters converge toward whatever
scores highest on the fitness metric -- the "genetic algorithm-like
optimization" Owen asked for. After the last generation, the single
best-ever candidate found across the whole search is re-evaluated once
more with the SAME Monte Carlo fidelity (n_simulations) as the main
pipeline, plus an out-of-sample holdout check, so the final report's
headline numbers are as trustworthy as the first report's.

IMPORTANT -- this is an in-sample search. It will always find *something*
that looks better on the exact historical window it was run against, even
if that improvement is pure noise. The holdout check and the prominent
overfitting-risk note in the generated report exist specifically to catch
that. Iterative Refinement should never be treated as proof a strategy
is better -- only as a faster way to generate candidates worth falsifying.

    days exactly the same as one that takes 40, as long as both eventually
    clear the bar. For a genuinely time-constrained goal ("I need a payout
    ASAP"), speed itself is the objective -- and median_days_to_first_payout

    Why this exists: Walk-Forward Optimization, Multi-Objective search,
    and the Walk-Forward-Aware GA all score every candidate (across every
    fold and every generation) the same way -- backtest it and read off
    stats. If the UNMODIFIED baseline strategy already produces zero
    trades on the WHOLE dataset, every single candidate downstream is

    the same data, and no amount of numeric-parameter tuning fixes a
    strategy that structurally never fires on this data/timeframe). The
    old behavior was to grind through every fold and every generation
    anyway and hand back a report that's all zeros / -inf / "infeasible"
    with no explanation -- expensive AND confusing. This catches it in
    under a second, before any of that work starts.
