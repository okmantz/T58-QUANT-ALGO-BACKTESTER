"""
Multi-asset / multi-strategy portfolio backtesting with correlation-aware
position sizing.

This app's engine (app.backtest.engine.run_backtest) is deliberately
single-instrument, single-open-position -- that's the right MVP shape for
validating one strategy on one instrument, and this module does not
rewrite it. Instead, a portfolio here is built in two honest, explicit
passes:

  Pass 1 (measure): run every instrument/strategy "leg" independently at
    its OWN nominal risk setting, to get each leg's own trade list and
    equity curve.

  Pass 2 (correlate + re-size): compute the correlation matrix of each
    leg's daily returns from Pass 1, derive a correlation-aware risk
    weight per leg (legs that move with the rest of the book get sized
    down; legs that diversify it keep more of their nominal risk), and
    re-run every leg with that adjusted RiskConfig.risk_value.

  Combine: every leg's final trades are merged into ONE chronological
  trade sequence and walked forward as a single shared account balance,
  which is what "trading a portfolio out of one prop account" actually
  means.

Known, explicitly-scoped limitations (an honest MVP, not a full
multi-asset event-driven engine):
  - The correlation-based re-weighting is a single static pass over the
    whole backtest window, not a rolling/intra-backtest rebalance. A
    strategy whose correlation structure changes materially over the
    test period will not have that captured.
  - Combining legs by chronological trade CLOSE time correctly aggregates
    realized P&L into one equity curve, but does not model shared margin
    or a portfolio-level max-concurrent-exposure cap across instruments
    that happen to have overlapping open trades. For most prop-firm
    single-account use cases (one balance, one drawdown floor, trading
    several instruments with the same account) this is the right model;
    for a margin-constrained multi-position book it understates risk.
