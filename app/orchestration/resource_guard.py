"""
Shared process-wide guardrails for T58's heavy, multi-worker-process
jobs (Search Lab, Evolution Lab, Full Pipeline batch, Speed Run).

Why this exists
----------------
Every one of those jobs independently spins up its own
ProcessPoolExecutor sized to (roughly) os.cpu_count() workers, and
each worker process loads its OWN full copy of the active market
data DataFrame (see app.search.batch_runner._init_worker and
app.evolution.engine._evo_init_worker). That's fine in isolation.

It is NOT fine if two or three of these jobs are started at the same
time in the same running app -- e.g. Evolution Lab left running
overnight, Full Pipeline batch started on top of it, then Speed Run
clicked on top of THAT. Each one independently claims the whole
machine's CPU count, so N simultaneous jobs try to hold N x
os.cpu_count() worker processes at once, each with its own copy of a
potentially large (months/years of 1-minute bars) DataFrame in
memory. On a real machine that is exactly the failure mode that looks
like "the whole desktop froze and then shut down" -- not a bug in any
one job, but the complete absence of any coordination between jobs
that each assume they own the whole machine.

This module provides two independent guardrails against that:

  HEAVY_JOB_GUARD    -- a simple named-slot lock. Only one heavy job
                        (by name) may be "active" at a time in this
                        process. Both the desktop GUI
                        (app.ui.main_window) and the web server
                        (app.web.server) import the same singleton,
                        so this protects whichever of the two entry
                        points is running -- it does NOT protect
                        against running the .exe AND the web server
                        at the same time from two separate OS
                        processes; there's no cheap way to guard
                        across process boundaries, so the UI-level
                        warning this enables is a strong hint, not an
                        absolute guarantee. If you run both, still
                        avoid stacking heavy jobs across them
                        yourself.

  safe_worker_count  -- caps a ProcessPoolExecutor's worker count so
                        that (workers x one worker's DataFrame memory
                        footprint) stays within a conservative budget
                        of AVAILABLE system memory, instead of
                        blindly using os.cpu_count() regardless of
                        how big the loaded dataset is. Falls back to
                        a conservative fixed assumption if psutil
                        isn't installed (it's an optional dependency
                        here, same as pywebview / MetaTrader5
                        elsewhere in this repo's requirements).
