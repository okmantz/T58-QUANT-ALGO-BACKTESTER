Full Pipeline -- one button that runs everything.

Every other tab in this app is a separate tool: Run & Report backtests
one fixed configuration, Iterative Refinement tunes it in-sample,
Walk-Forward-Aware GA tunes it against out-of-sample folds, Validation
Lab checks robustness after the fact. Getting from "here's a strategy
file" to "here's the best, validated version of it, ready for a prop
firm" means running several of those in the right order and carrying
the winner from one into the next by hand.

This module does that hand-off automatically:

    Step 1  Baseline           -- one backtest of the strategy exactly as
                                   given, plus a lookahead-bias check for
                                   code strategies. Fails fast (in under a
                                   second) if this produces zero trades,
                                   rather than wasting minutes discovering
                                   that fact three more times over.
    Step 2  Robust optimization -- app.optimize.walkforward_ga's GA, which
                                   scores every candidate ONLY on chained
                                   out-of-sample fold performance (never
                                   in-sample), specifically so the "best"
                                   configuration it finds is one that
                                   generalizes rather than one that just
                                   curve-fits the baseline harder. Skipped
                                   gracefully (not a failure) if the
                                   strategy has no tunable numeric
                                   parameters -- the baseline then IS the
                                   final configuration.
    Step 3  Final validation    -- the winning configuration is re-run
                                   through a full backtest, prop-firm
                                   simulation, and full-fidelity Monte
                                   Carlo on the WHOLE dataset (more
                                   simulations than the search phase used,
                                   since this is the one that counts).
    Step 4  Out-of-sample check -- app.search.robustness.run_walk_forward
                                   on the exact winning configuration, NO
                                   further re-tuning: does this exact
                                   strategy keep working across several
                                   distinct historical stretches?
    Step 5  Holdout check       -- the same chronological in-sample/
                                   holdout split every other pipeline run
                                   in this app already does.
    Step 6  Report + save       -- one full HTML/JSON report (the same
                                   generate_full_report every other run
                                   produces) for the FINAL strategy, a
                                   plain-language verdict, and -- for code
                                   strategies -- the winning source saved
                                   straight into the Strategy Library,
                                   tagged "validated", ready to hand to a
                                   prop firm or plug back into the app.

Every step is best-effort past Step 2: a step that can't run (e.g. not
enough bars for a walk-forward check) is recorded as skipped with a
reason, never allowed to take down a run that otherwise succeeded.

    backtest) against every item in `items`, writing one full report per
    strategy and recording each result back onto its own Strategy Library
    metadata exactly like a single Full Pipeline run already does.

    This exists specifically because Strategy Library multi-select +
    the batch queue previously only ever fed app.orchestration.batch_test
    (a plain backtest -> prop-sim -> Monte Carlo pipeline) -- there was no
    way to run the full 7-step Full Pipeline against more than one
    strategy without loading and running each one individually. This is
    the batch equivalent of that: same idea as run_batch_test, just
    calling the heavier, more thorough pipeline per item instead.

    One bad strategy (backtest error, zero trades, a GA/validation step
    that fails) is recorded as a failed outcome and the rest of the batch
    keeps going -- it never aborts the whole run. Every item uses the same
    `cfg` (GA population/generations/etc.) and the same `risk`/`prop_rules`
    -- whatever is configured on the Full Pipeline tab at the moment the
    batch is started.

    max_parallel_strategies: 1 (default) preserves the original strictly-
    sequential behavior with full live per-step logging. Set higher (e.g.
    3-4 on an 8+ core machine) to run that many strategies' pipelines
    concurrently in separate worker processes -- this was the single
    biggest lever for cutting a large batch's wall-clock time (a real
    23-strategy/~1-hour batch is CPU-bound almost entirely inside Step 2's
    GA search, which already parallelizes ACROSS a genome population; this
    additionally parallelizes ACROSS strategies). To avoid oversubscribing
    the machine, each item's own GA worker-process count
    (cfg.parallel_search_max_workers) is automatically capped to roughly
    os.cpu_count() // max_parallel_strategies (minimum 1) whenever the
    caller hasn't already pinned an explicit value; pass a `cfg` with
    parallel_search_max_workers set to override this. Per-item live
    progress logs are unavailable in this mode (see _batch_item_worker) --
    only start/finish lines are logged for each item; drop back to 1 if
