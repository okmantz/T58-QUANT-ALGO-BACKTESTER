PyInstaller entry point.

This file must stay at the repository root, *outside* the ``app`` package.

Why this file exists:
    The previous build pointed PyInstaller directly at ``app/main.py``.
    Because that script lives *inside* the ``app`` package (a directory
    containing ``app/__init__.py``), PyInstaller's import analysis treats
    the script's own directory as the search root instead of the repo
    root. That makes ``from app.ui.main_window import launch`` inside
    ``app/main.py`` unresolvable at freeze time, which is exactly why the
    packaged .exe crashed on launch with:

        ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.ui.main_window'

    Pointing PyInstaller at this file instead fixes that: this script's
    directory *is* the repo root, so the ``app`` package is found
    normally, both when run with plain ``python run_app.py`` and when
    frozen into an .exe.

    # On Windows, a frozen/PyInstaller build has no real `fork()` -- every
    # worker process is started by re-launching this SAME .exe from
    # scratch. Without freeze_support() called first, each of those
    # re-launches falls through to `main()` again instead of running as a
    # plain worker, so every worker process tries to boot a second copy of
    # the whole Tkinter GUI, immediately conflicts with the already-running
    # instance, and dies -- which is exactly what surfaces to the user as
    # "concurrent.futures.process.BrokenProcessPool: A process in the
    # process pool was terminated abruptly while the future was running or
    # pending" as soon as Search Lab starts Stage 1. freeze_support() makes
    # multiprocessing detect it's being called as a worker re-launch and
    # skip straight to running the worker, instead of falling through to
    # main(). This is a no-op (returns immediately) on macOS/Linux and when
    # NOT frozen, so it's always safe to call first.
